Does as instructed

calculates the number of nodes 
per color and also calculates the number of edges
connected to any node of that color, this is
done with the function partA

partB calculates the most influential node in each
partition, that means the node that has the
most edges (this includes nodes that are external),
then it returns all the most influential nodes in
the graph

call start(inputfile, outputA, outputB) to see your
results

so far, works well for all the test cases attempted.
